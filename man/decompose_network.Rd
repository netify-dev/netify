\title{Break down a \code{network} object into base R components}
\usage{
decompose_network(ntwk, weight = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{ntwk}{A network object.}

\item{weight}{An optional character string specifying the edge attribute to use as weights. Defaults to NULL.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\describe{
\item{adj_mat}{The adjacency matrix extracted from the network object.}
\item{ndata}{A data frame of vertex attributes, or NULL if not available.}
\item{ddata}{A data frame of edge attributes combined with vertex names, or NULL if not available.}
\item{weight}{The edge attribute name used, if provided.}
}
}
\description{
This function processes a network object from the network package to extract its adjacency matrix along with any available vertex and edge attributes, and returns them in a standardized list format.
}
\details{
If the network does not have vertex names, default names are assigned:
\itemize{
\item For bipartite networks: rows are labeled as "r1", "r2", etc., and columns as "c1", "c2", etc.
\item For unipartite networks: all vertices are labeled as "a1", "a2", etc.
}
Note: For longitudinal networks with changing actor composition, it is recommended
to explicitly name vertices before conversion to ensure consistent actor identification across time periods.
