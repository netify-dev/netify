\title{Extract actor time range information from dyadic data}
\usage{
get_actor_time_info(dyad_data, actor1, actor2, time)
}
\arguments{
\item{dyad_data}{A data.frame containing longitudinal dyadic observations. Must
include columns for two actors and time periods. Will be coerced to data.frame
if a tibble or data.table is provided.}

\item{actor1}{Character string specifying the column name for the first actor
in each dyad.}

\item{actor2}{Character string specifying the column name for the second actor
in each dyad.}

\item{time}{Character string specifying the column name for time periods.}
}
\value{
A data.frame with three columns containing actor-level time information:
\itemize{
\item \strong{actor}: Character vector of unique actor identifiers found
in either actor1 or actor2 columns
\item \strong{min_time}: The earliest time period in which each actor
appears in the data (entry point)
\item \strong{max_time}: The latest time period in which each actor
appears in the data (exit point)
}

Actors are ordered as they appear in the aggregation, not alphabetically or
by time.
}
\description{
\code{get_actor_time_info} analyzes a longitudinal dyadic dataset to determine when
each actor enters and exits the network. Entry is defined as the first time
period in which an actor appears in any interaction (as either sender or
receiver), and exit as the last time period.
}
\details{
The function performs the following operations:

\strong{Data processing:}
\enumerate{
\item Combines actor1 and actor2 columns into a single nodal format
\item Aggregates by actor to find minimum and maximum time periods
\item Returns a clean data.frame with one row per unique actor
}

\strong{Use cases:}

Main usage in this package is to:
\itemize{
\item Preparing actor existence information for the \code{actor_pds} parameter in
\code{netify()}
}

\strong{Assumptions:}
\itemize{
\item An actor is considered "present" in any time period where they appear
in the data, regardless of their role (sender/receiver)
\item Missing values in time periods are ignored when calculating min/max
\item Actors must appear in at least one non-missing time period
}
}
\note{
The function assumes that presence in the data indicates network participation.
If actors can be temporarily absent from the network while still being considered
members, this function will not capture such gaps.
