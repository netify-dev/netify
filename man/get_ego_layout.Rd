\usage{
get_ego_layout(
  netlet,
  layout = "star",
  group_by = NULL,
  order_by = NULL,
  weight_to_distance = FALSE,
  ring_gap = 0.3,
  ego_size = 0.1,
  seed = 6886
)
}
\arguments{
\item{netlet}{A netify object (class "netify") that is an ego network, created
using \code{\link{ego_netify}}. The object must have ego_netify = TRUE attribute.}

\item{layout}{Character string specifying the ego-centric layout algorithm. Options:
\itemize{
\item \code{"radial"}: Places ego at center with alters arranged in a circle
around it. Distance from center can encode relationship strength.
\item \code{"concentric"}: Places ego at center with alters in concentric
circles based on a grouping variable or relationship strength.
\item \code{"star"}: Simple star layout with ego at center and alters
equally spaced around it (default).
}}

\item{group_by}{Character string specifying a nodal attribute to use for grouping
alters in the layout. For "radial" layout, groups are arranged in sectors.
For "concentric" layout, groups determine which ring alters appear in.
If NULL (default), no grouping is applied.}

\item{order_by}{Character string specifying a nodal attribute to use for ordering
alters within their groups or around the ego. Common options include network
statistics like "degree_total" or custom attributes. If NULL (default),
alters are arranged alphabetically.}

\item{weight_to_distance}{Logical. If TRUE and the network is weighted, use edge
weights to determine distance from ego (higher weights = closer). For "radial"
layout only. Default is FALSE.}

\item{ring_gap}{Numeric value between 0 and 1 specifying the gap between
concentric rings as a proportion of the total radius. Only used for
"concentric" layout. Default is 0.3.}

\item{ego_size}{Numeric value specifying the relative size of the central area
reserved for the ego. Larger values create more space between ego and alters.
Default is 0.1.}

\item{seed}{Integer for random number generation to ensure reproducible layouts
when there are ties in ordering. Default is 6886.}
}
\value{
A list of data frames (one per time period) where each data frame contains:
\itemize{
\item \strong{index}: Integer node index
\item \strong{actor}: Character string with actor name
\item \strong{x}: Numeric x-coordinate for node position
\item \strong{y}: Numeric y-coordinate for node position
}

For cross-sectional networks, returns a list with one element. For longitudinal
networks, returns a named list with time periods as names.

\description{
\code{get_ego_layout} computes node positions for ego network visualization using
ego-centric layout algorithms. These layouts place the ego at the center and
arrange alters in meaningful patterns around it, making the ego's relationships
more visually apparent.
}
\details{
This function provides specialized layouts for ego networks that emphasize the
ego-alter structure:

\strong{Layout algorithms:}
\itemize{
\item \strong{Radial}: Places the ego at the origin and arranges alters in
a circle around it. If grouping is specified, alters are arranged in sectors
with related nodes near each other. If weight_to_distance is TRUE, alters
with stronger ties to ego are placed closer to the center.
\item \strong{Concentric}: Places the ego at the origin and arranges alters
in concentric circles. The ring assignment can be based on a grouping
variable (categorical) or a continuous variable (discretized into rings).
\item \strong{Star}: A simple star layout that places ego at center and
distributes alters evenly around a single circle. This is equivalent to
the radial layout without grouping or weighting.
}

\strong{Visual encoding:}

The layouts allow encoding of network properties through spatial arrangement:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Distance from ego}: Can represent tie strength, frequency of
interaction, or other dyadic measures
\item \strong{Angular position}: Can group similar alters together (e.g.,
family, friends, colleagues)
\item \strong{Ring assignment}: Can represent categories, levels of importance,
or discretized continuous variables
}

\strong{Longitudinal networks:}

For longitudinal ego networks, the function maintains consistent angular positions
for alters across time periods when possible, making it easier to track changes
in the ego's network over time.
}
\note{
This function is designed specifically for ego networks created with
\code{\link{ego_netify}}. For general network layouts, use
\code{\link{get_node_layout}}.

The function will issue a warning if used on non-ego networks but will
attempt to proceed by treating the first node as the ego.

# Create an ego network

# Get radial layout with alters grouped by attribute

# Get concentric layout with rings based on degree

                                layout = "concentric", 
                                group_by = "degree_total")

# Use with plot
