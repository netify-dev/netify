\title{Preview subsets of network data from netify objects}
\usage{
peek(netlet, actors = NULL, from = 3, to = 3, time = 1, layers = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{netlet}{A netify object to preview. Can be cross-sectional, longitudinal
(array or list format), and/or multilayer.}

\item{actors}{Character vector of actor names or numeric indices to subset.
Selects these actors as both senders and receivers (extracts subgraph among
these actors). Overridden by \code{from} and \code{to} if specified.}

\item{from}{Specifies which actors to display as senders of ties (row actors
in the adjacency matrix). Can be:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Single number}: Shows the first n actors (e.g., \code{from = 5}
displays actors 1-5)
\item \strong{Numeric vector}: Shows specific positions (e.g., \code{from = c(1,3,5)}
displays the 1st, 3rd, and 5th actors)
\item \strong{Character vector}: Shows named actors (e.g., \code{from = c("USA", "China")}
displays these specific countries)
\item \strong{NULL}: Shows all row actors (default is 3)
}
In bipartite networks, from represents actors in the first mode.}

\item{to}{Specifies which actors to display as receivers of ties (column actors
in the adjacency matrix). Accepts the same input types as \code{from}. In
bipartite networks, columns represent actors in the second mode. Default is 3.}

\item{time}{For longitudinal networks, specifies which time periods to display. Can be:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Single number}: Shows the nth time period (e.g., \code{time = 1}
shows the first time period)
\item \strong{Numeric vector}: Shows specific time indices (e.g., \code{time = c(1,5,10)})
\item \strong{Character vector}: Shows named time periods (e.g., \code{time = c("2002", "2006")}
displays these specific years)
\item \strong{NULL}: Shows all time periods
}
Default is 1 (first time period only). Ignored for cross-sectional networks.}

\item{layers}{For multilayer networks, specifies which layer(s) to display. Must be
a character vector matching layer names in the netify object (e.g.,
\code{layers = c("trade", "alliance")}). For single-layer networks, this
parameter is ignored. Default is NULL (shows all layers).}
}
\value{
Returns a subset of the raw network data (without netify attributes):

\describe{
\item{\strong{Cross-sectional networks}}{
\itemize{
\item Single layer: Returns a matrix with selected rows and columns
\item Multilayer: Returns a 3D array (rows × columns × layers)
}
}
\item{\strong{Longitudinal networks}}{
\itemize{
\item Array format: Returns an array with dimensions depending on selection
\item List format: Returns a list of matrices, one per selected time period
}
}
}

All returned objects preserve dimension names (actor names, time labels, layer
names) for easy interpretation. Single dimensions are automatically dropped.
}
\description{
\code{peek} provides a
convenient way to inspect portions of network data stored in netify objects.
Rather than displaying entire networks (which can be overwhelming for large
datasets), this function allows you to examine specific actors, time periods,
or layers for data exploration, verification, and debugging.
}
\details{
\strong{Purpose and Design}

\code{peek} is designed as a lightweight data exploration tool. Unlike
\code{\link{subset_netify}}, which creates new netify objects with all attributes
preserved, \code{peek} returns only the raw network data for quick inspection.
This makes it ideal for:
\itemize{
\item Verifying data structure and content
\item Checking specific relationships
\item Debugging data issues
\item Quick visual inspection of network patterns
}

\strong{Understanding Network Directions}

In directed networks:
\itemize{
\item \strong{From} represents actors sending ties (out-ties)
\item \strong{To} represents actors receiving ties (in-ties)
\item Cell \code{[i,j]} contains the tie from actor i to actor j
}

For example, if cell \code{["USA", "China"]} = 5, this means USA sends a tie of
strength 5 to China.

\strong{Smart Selection Behavior}

The function includes several convenience features:
\itemize{
\item Single numbers are expanded to ranges (e.g., \code{from = 5} becomes first 5 actors)
\item Out-of-bounds indices are silently ignored (no errors during exploration)
\item Character names are matched to actor labels
\item Dimension reduction: if only one time period or layer is selected, that
dimension is dropped from the output
}
}
\note{
\strong{Important distinctions:}
\itemize{
\item Use \code{peek} for quick data inspection (returns raw matrices)
\item Use \code{\link{subset_netify}} to create new netify objects with attributes
\item Use \code{\link{get_raw}} to extract all raw data from a netify object
}

When multiple layers are present and no layer selection is specified, all layers
are returned with a warning message to remind you about the multilayer structure.

\examples{
# Load example data
data(icews)

# Example 1: Basic usage with cross-sectional network
icews_10 <- icews[icews$year == 2010, ]
net <- netify(
    icews_10,
    actor1 = "i", actor2 = "j",
    weight = "verbCoop"
)

# Default: see first 3 actors (both sending and receiving)
peek(net)

# See first 5 senders and first 5 receivers
peek(net, from = 5, to = 5)

# Example 2: Specific actors by name
# See ties from US and China to Russia, India, and Brazil
peek(net,
    from = c("United States", "China"),
    to = c("Russia", "India", "Brazil")
)

# Use actors parameter to see subgraph
peek(net,
    actors = c("United States", "China", "Russia")
)

# Example 3: Longitudinal network
net_longit <- netify(
    icews,
    actor1 = "i", actor2 = "j", time = "year",
    weight = "matlConf"
)

# See first 5 actors in specific years
peek(net_longit,
    from = 5, to = 5,
    time = c("2002", "2006", "2010")
)

# See all actors in year 2010
peek(net_longit,
    from = NULL, to = NULL,
    time = "2010"
)

# Example 4: Using numeric indices
# See specific positions in the network
peek(net,
    from = c(1, 3, 5, 7), # 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th senders
    to = 1:10
) # first 10 receivers

# Example 5: Quick inspection patterns
# See who USA interacts with
peek(net, from = "United States", to = 10) # USA's ties to first 10 countries
peek(net, from = 10, to = "United States") # First 10 countries' ties to USA
