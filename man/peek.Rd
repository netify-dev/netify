\arguments{
\item{netlet}{A netify object to preview.}

\item{what_to_peek}{Specifies which actors/nodes to display. Can be:
\itemize{
\item A numeric value (e.g., 3) to show the first n rows and columns
\item A numeric vector specifying row/column indices (e.g., c(1,3,5))
\item A character vector of actor names (e.g., c("USA", "China"))
}
Default is 3 (first three rows and columns).}

\item{what_rows_to_peek}{Specific rows to display. Accepts same input types as
\code{what_to_peek}. Defaults to the value of \code{what_to_peek}. Set to NULL to
display all rows.}

\item{what_cols_to_peek}{Specific columns to display. Accepts same input types
as \code{what_to_peek}. Defaults to the value of \code{what_to_peek}. Set to NULL to
display all columns.}

\item{when_to_peek}{For longitudinal networks, specifies which time points to
display. Can be:
\itemize{
\item A numeric value or vector for time indices (e.g., 1 or c(1,5,10))
\item A character vector matching time labels (e.g., c("2002", "2006"))
\item NULL to display all time points
}
Default is 1 (first time point).}

\item{what_layers_to_peek}{For multilayer networks, specifies which layer(s) to
display. Must be a character vector matching layer names. Required if the
netify object has multiple layers.}
}
\value{
Returns a subset of the network data matching the specified criteria:
\itemize{
\item For cross-sectional networks: a matrix
\item For longitudinal arrays: an array (or matrix if one time point)
\item For longitudinal lists: a list of matrices
}
The returned object maintains dimension names for easy interpretation.
}
\description{
\code{peek} (also available as \code{preview}, \code{inspect}, \code{glimpse_netify})
provides a convenient way to inspect portions of network data stored in
netify objects. Rather than displaying entire networks (which can be overwhelming
for large datasets), \code{peek} allows you to examine specific actors, time periods,
or layers. This is particularly useful for data exploration, verification, and
debugging network analyses.
}
\details{
The function handles different netify object types:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Cross-sectional}: Subsets by rows and columns (and layers if multilayer)
\item \strong{Longitudinal array}: Subsets by rows, columns, time, and optionally layers
\item \strong{Longitudinal list}: Subsets each time period's matrix separately,
accommodating actor sets that change over time
}

When using character vectors to specify actors, the function automatically matches
them to the appropriate row/column positions. For longitudinal lists where actors
may vary across time periods, matching is performed separately for each period.

\examples{
# Load data
data(icews)

# Create cross-sectional network
icews_10 <- icews[icews$year=='2010', ]
icews_verbCoop <- netify(
  dyad_data=icews_10, actor1='i', actor2='j',
  symmetric=FALSE, weight='verbCoop'
)

# Peek at first 3x3 subset (default)
peek(icews_verbCoop)

# Peek at specific countries
peek(icews_verbCoop,
  what_to_peek = c('United Kingdom', 'United States', 'France'))

# Different row and column selections
peek(icews_verbCoop,
  what_rows_to_peek = c('United Kingdom', 'United States', 'France'),
  what_cols_to_peek = c('Russian Federation', 'Sri Lanka'))

# Create longitudinal network
icews_matlConf <- netify(
  dyad_data=icews, 
  actor1='i', actor2='j', time='year',
  symmetric=FALSE, weight='matlConf',
  output_format = 'longit_array'
)

# Peek at specific years using indices
peek(icews_matlConf, when_to_peek=c(1, 5, 10))

# Or using year labels
peek(icews_matlConf, when_to_peek=c('2002', '2006', '2011'))

# View all time periods for specific countries
peek(icews_matlConf, 
  what_to_peek = c('United States', 'China'),
  when_to_peek = NULL)
