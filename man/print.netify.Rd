\title{Print method for netify objects}
\usage{
\method{print}{netify}(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A netify object}

\item{...}{Additional parameters (not used)}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns the input netify object. Called for its side effect
of printing network information to the console.
}
\description{
Displays a formatted summary of a netify object, including network type,
dimensions, summary statistics, and available attributes.
}
\details{
The print method displays:
\itemize{
\item Network type (unipartite/bipartite, symmetric/asymmetric)
\item Edge weight specification
\item Temporal structure (cross-sectional or number of time periods)
\item Actor counts (total unique actors, or separate row/column counts for bipartite)
\item Summary statistics (density, reciprocity, transitivity, etc.)
\item Available nodal and dyadic attributes
}

For longitudinal networks, summary statistics are averaged across time periods.
For multilayer networks, statistics are shown separately for each layer.
