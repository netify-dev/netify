\title{Subset netify objects}
\usage{
\method{subset}{netify}(
  x,
  actors = NULL,
  time = NULL,
  layers = NULL,
  from = NULL,
  to = NULL,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A netify object to subset}

\item{actors}{Character vector of actor names or numeric indices to subset.
Extracts the subgraph among these actors (includes ties both from and to
these actors). Default is NULL, which includes all actors.}

\item{time}{Time periods to subset. Can be:
\itemize{
\item Numeric vector: used as indices to the time dimension
\item Character vector: matched against time dimension labels
\item NULL: includes all time periods (default)
}}

\item{layers}{Character vector of layer names to subset from multilayer networks.
For single-layer networks, this is ignored. For multilayer networks, at least
one layer must be specified.}

\item{from}{Character vector of actor names or numeric indices for actors sending
ties (row actors). Overrides \code{actors}. Set to NULL to include all
sending actors. In bipartite networks, this refers to actors in the first mode.}

\item{to}{Character vector of actor names or numeric indices for actors receiving
ties (column actors). Overrides \code{actors}. Set to NULL to include all
receiving actors. In bipartite networks, this refers to actors in the second mode.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (currently unused)}
}
\value{
A netify object containing the requested subset with:
\itemize{
\item Subsetted adjacency matrix/matrices
\item Corresponding nodal attributes (filtered to included actors/times)
\item Corresponding dyadic attributes (filtered to included actor pairs/times)
\item Updated netify attributes reflecting the new dimensions
}

The returned object's structure depends on the subset:
\itemize{
\item If one time period is selected from longitudinal data, returns cross-sectional
\item If one layer is selected from multilayer data, returns single-layer
\item Otherwise, maintains the original structure type
}
}
\description{
Extracts a subset of a netify object based on specified actors, time periods,
and/or layers while preserving all netify attributes and structure.
}
\details{
This function is a netify-aware wrapper around the \code{\link{peek}} function,
which handles the raw data extraction. While \code{peek} returns raw matrices/arrays,
\code{subset} additionally:
\itemize{
\item Preserves and updates all netify attributes
\item Filters nodal and dyadic attribute data to match the subset
\item Adjusts the netify type when dimensions change (e.g., longitudinal to cross-sectional)
\item Maintains consistency between network data and attributes
}

The \code{from} and \code{to} parameters allow precise control over which ties
to include:
\itemize{
\item Use \code{actors} to get all ties among a set of actors (subgraph extraction)
\item Use \code{from} to get all ties sent by specific actors
\item Use \code{to} to get all ties received by specific actors
\item Use both \code{from} and \code{to} to get ties between specific sets of actors
}

For bipartite networks, \code{from} refers to actors in the first mode (e.g.,
people) and \code{to} refers to actors in the second mode (e.g., organizations).
}
\note{
When subsetting longitudinal data to a single time period, the function automatically
converts the result to a cross-sectional netify object. Similarly, subsetting
multilayer data to a single layer produces a single-layer object.

# load example directed event data from ICEWS
data(icews)

# generate a longitudional netify object
# with both dyadic and nodal attributes
icews_matlConf <- netify(

    symmetric = FALSE, weight = "matlConf",

    dyad_vars_symmetric = c(FALSE, FALSE, FALSE)
)

# subset to a few countries using S3 method

    icews_matlConf,
    actors = c(
        "United States", "United Kingdom",

# subset to a few countries and a few years
icews_subset_2 <- subset(

# can also use subset_netify directly

    netlet = icews_matlConf,
