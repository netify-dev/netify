  to = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{netlet}{A netify object to subset}

\item{actors}{Character vector of actor names or numeric indices to subset}

\item{time}{Time periods to subset}

\item{layers}{Character vector of layer names to subset from multilayer networks}

\item{from}{Character vector of actor names or numeric indices for actors sending ties}

\item{to}{Character vector of actor names or numeric indices for actors receiving ties}
}

This is the internal workhorse function called by the S3 method \code{subset.netify}.

this function directly.
